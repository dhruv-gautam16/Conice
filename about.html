                <ul>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Allowing users to buy leftover items at a reduced price</span>: This feature enables users to purchase food items that would have otherwise gone to waste, reducing food waste and providing affordable options for consumers.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Allowing users to sell or give their spoilt items for reuse</span>: Users can offer their spoiled food items, which can be repurposed or transformed into other usable forms, reducing waste and promoting a circular economy.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Allowing users to sell left-over or near-expired items at a lower price</span>: This feature provides a platform for users to sell their surplus or close-to-expiration food items, preventing them from being wasted and allowing others to purchase them at a discounted price.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Performing data analysis to predict food consumption patterns</span>: The application analyzes data to predict the consumption patterns of organizations, helping them optimize their food management and reduce waste.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Displaying a user's contribution to a greener planet</span>: The app tracks and showcases a user's efforts in reducing food waste through visual representations like pie charts or graphs, encouraging and motivating them to continue their sustainable practices.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Establishing a 5km radius for available items</span>: To minimize travel, costs, and time, the app ensures that all available items for users are within a 5km radius. Users can choose between delivery or pick-up options, with delivery incurring additional charges.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Providing a dashboard for restaurants and sellers</span>: The dashboard displays the amount of food, items, and money saved or donated by restaurants and sellers. This feature encourages them to do more and enables sellers to donate excess food to NGOs, orphanages, shelter homes, etc.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Converting expired or leftover food to manure</span>: When a threshold for spoiled food is reached in a specific area, pick-up of those items occurs. The food waste can be converted into manure and taken to manure industry for further processing.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Exploring the use of food waste in the construction sector</span>: Research is being conducted to utilize leftovers and spoiled food in the construction sector due to their binding properties.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Promoting surplus swaps</span>: Users can swap their surplus food with others, specifying the type, quantity, expiration date, and what they are seeking in return. The app facilitates the matching process and communication for food swaps, further reducing food waste.</li>
                    <li><span class="lightGreen2">Utilizing rice husk by-products for piezoelectric tiles</span>: Rice husk, a by-product of rice cultivation, can be processed to extract silica. This silica can be used in creating piezoelectric tiles that generate energy when people walk on them. The energy generated can be used for lighting common places like metro or train stations, contributing to waste reduction and a sustainable environment.</li>
